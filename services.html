                <p>Your customers just learned what services you offer. Tell them why they<br>
                     should work with you or your team, for example you could highlight your<br>
                     experience and positive client reviews.
                    <br.<br><br>
                     The badges illustrate this.  We also focus on key benefits they will get while <br>
                     using our services, namely quick turnaround times and dedicated support. <br>
                     You could also use them to show awards you won for your best work.</p>
